# 📘 Overview
CodeQuest: Escape the Lab is a serious educational game developed as part of a Master's thesis at the University of West Attica (UniWA).
The project explores how Virtual Reality (VR) and gamification techniques can enhance the learning experience of programming, focusing on fundamental programming structures such as:

Selection structures (if, if-else)

Iteration (for, while)

Arrays (1D & 2D)

Through immersive 3D interactions, players solve puzzles that require applying these concepts to progress and “escape” from a virtual laboratory.

# 🎯 Purpose and Research Context
The project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-based learning environments in improving programming comprehension and engagement compared to traditional teaching methods.
The study includes a pre- and post-test experimental design and a user feedback questionnaire assessing usability, engagement, and perceived learning outcomes.
